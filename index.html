    <p style="font-size: 20px;color:white;text-align: justify;max-width: 80%;padding-left: 50px;padding-top: 30px;">Non-rotating black hole:<br>
      Schwarzschild black hole, no such black hole, in reality, we introduce this kind of black hole since it's better easier to demonstrate the black hole environment. The radius of the event horizon: 3km x Mass of Blackhole/Mass of Sun; innermost stable orbit: 3 times the radius of the event horizon; photon sphere: 1.5 times the radius of the event horizon.</p>

     Rotating black hole:<br>
     Known as Kerr black hole. The material for the accretion disc comes from an orbiting star, and thus has angular momentum that causes the disc to rotate, as rotating, the event horizon shrinks to 0.5 sizes of the non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. ISCO decreases from 3 times the Schwarzschild radius to coincide with the shrunk event horizon. The rotation of the black hole drags spacetime along with it, known as frame-dragging. </p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:black;"><p style="font-size: 20px;color:white;text-align: justify;max-width: 80%;padding-left: 50px;padding-top: 15px;"> Tidal force:<br>
    Heard about spaghettification? that is caused by the tidal force. a tidal force is smaller if the black hole has a larger mass since tidal force near the event horizon is smaller ->from the event horizon equation: R=2GM/c^2 and the tidal force equation: F=GM/r^2, we know if the mass is larger, the radius of the event horizon is larger, tidal force thus will be smaller... And the mass needs to have 1000 times the Sun's mass to be safe to visit!</p></div>

    <p class="content">With a brief introduction above, we can talk a little more about rotating black holes. How to know whether the black hole is rotating or not? answer: by analyzing the reflected x-ray spectrum off of the accretion disk, we can know how close the accretion disk is close to the black hole.</p>
    <h1 style="padding-top:10px;color: black;padding-left:30px;padding-bottom:5px;">Phenomenons</h1>
    <p class="content">
      · Ergosphere: the outer boundary of the ergosphere is called the 'stationary limit'. Outside the stationary limit, a spacecraft can park with respect to the black hole, but inside the stationary limit, spacecraft can no longer stay rest.
     <br>
     <br>
     · Penrose process: there might exist a higher civilization that can take the advantage of the black hole! they might get more kinetic energy by throwing something inside of a black hole and getting more energy to move forward... Or they can even store extra energy in a black hole and for later use.
    <br>
    <br>
    · The ugly thing -- Singularity, it's so peculiar and ugly that the universe itself doesn't want it to expose to the universe! we call it the cosmic censorship hypothesis. Anything will be compressed to 0, nothing can explain it... From Newton's gravitation equation: F=GMm/r^2, where r=0, and from a mathematical perspective, we can't divide things to 0.....see, this place doesn't make sense! For a non-rotating black hole, the singularity is a point, for a rotating black hole, the singularity is a ring and it may be exposed to the universe.., we call it 'ring singularity' or 'naked singularity. From the graph of right, the information still can be received around the outer horizon, but around the inner horizon(Cauchy horizon), the information of the entire history of the entire universe is compressed.
    <br>
    Or, if the black hole does not rotate, the singularity is inside of the black hole, if an astronaut travels into a black hole, he will definitely bump into the singularity at any future time from his reference frame. The singularity exists in the future time, since you can't go backward in time, you have no choice but to continue to future times, which means you need to move towards to smaller value of the radius of the event horizon, to the center.

  <h1 style="padding-top:10px;color: black;padding-left:30px;padding-bottom:5px;">How do we observe?</h1>
  <p class="content">The telescope of course! There are different types of telescopes, reflecting and refracting telescopes. Reflecting telescope: -- gathering and focusing light using a curved mirror. Refracting telescope: telescope made with lenses.
    <br>
    resolution of a telescope: telescopes have the smallest angle that they can resolve, resolution depends on the wavelength of the light, a larger telescope can resolve more details. For example, from the right diagram, two beams of light moving from far away towards an observer, from far away, an observer can really not tell it's two beams of light or one beam of light, since it's so far and blurry. As the light moving towards the observer, in other words, as they get closer and closer, the beams of light are clearer to the observer. Same as the telescope, as mentioned, telescopes have the smallest angle that they can resolve, any objects smaller than this will be blurry. Small telescope and large telescope: dim, distant objects like nebula and galaxies can be resolved by small telescope with low magnification, large telescope allows more magnification, something that looks really small and dim through a small telescope will be clear in a large telescope.
  <br>
<br>
· optical telescope: visible light telescope, capable of viewing steller companions of a black hole. Radio telescope: detect black hole electromagnetic waves like radio waves(emitted by jet), normally radio telescope with dishes, light waves from neighboring radio telescopes in an array can be combined using interferometry, which means allows a group of the telescope to act as a large one.
<br>
<br>
· Spectroscopy: except for the prism which can disperse light, another object -- diffraction grating: separate light into component colors. Imaging Spectroscopy: a telescope with spectrometer -> collecting a spectrum for each pixel of an image, scientists can then distinguish what colors are produced in different locations of the object.

  <h1 style="padding-top:10px;color: black;padding-left:30px;padding-bottom:5px;">what can we know from the observations?</h1>
  <p class="content"> Determine chemical composition using emission and absorption spectrum: each type of atom or molecule has a unique set of energy levels that produce a unique set of emission lines. If a light source like a star is shined, we see black body spectrum produce as a continuous rainbow of colors; if a star is a cooler outer atmosphere or photosphere, atoms will absorb photons, creating an absorption spectrum; if the light from a star strikes a nebula from the side, electrons will be excited and fall to lower energy state, produce emission line spectrum.
<br>
<br>
Disc light spectrum: multi-colored disc model(see figure on the right): disc made up of multiple rings, each ring emitting radiation at a different temperature, inner rings hotter, outer rings cooler. Each ring peaks at a different wavelength. For stellar-mass black hole like Cygnus X-1 with a peak wavelength of X-rays, its tail extends from visible light to ultraviolet; more massive black hole with a peak wavelength of ultraviolet: since the inner ring of the accretion disc is far from the center of the black hole, it's cooler, using ultraviolet telescope we see redshift of these ultraviolet photons and can be observed in the optical or infrared spectrum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Corona: this region is likely happening inverse Compton scattering. corona photons originate from the disc, when photons from the disc escape, they meet high-energy electrons in the corona and gain energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  jet emission: jets are powered by synchrotron radiation, energizing photons through interactions with electrons that are trapped in circular orbits around the magnetic fields within the jet. (see figure on the right) a supermassive black hole like M87, its jets produce light of all the types in the electromagnetic spectrum from the lowest frequency to highest frequency(<i>Telescope unit in unprecedented observations of famous black hole, n.d.</i>)
<br>
<br>
Jet type: continuous jet: is a continuous stream of particles constantly flowing outward along the path of the jet. Burps: clumps of particles being emitted out of the jet abruptly.
